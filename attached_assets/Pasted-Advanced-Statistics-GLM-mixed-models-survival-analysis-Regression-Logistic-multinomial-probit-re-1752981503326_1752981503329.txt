Great question! Here's a breakdown of Graphs, Plots, Diagrams, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and Quality Control Charts support in both IBM SPSS and R:

📊 IBM SPSS
✅ Graphs and Plots (Built-in & GUI-based)
SPSS offers drag-and-drop interfaces and chart builders to create a wide range of visualizations:

Visualization Type	Availability	Description
Bar/Column Charts	✅	Simple, clustered, stacked
Pie Charts	✅	2D and 3D options
Histograms	✅	With normal curve overlay
Boxplots	✅	Single or grouped boxplots
Line Graphs	✅	For time-series or progression
Scatterplots	✅	Simple, matrix, 3D
Error Bars	✅	Mean ± SD or SE
Density/Curve Plots	⛔ (limited)	Not native, workarounds required
Heatmaps/Correlation	❌ (no native support)	Requires extensions or external tools

📊 EDA Tools in SPSS
Frequencies & Descriptives: Mean, median, range, SD

Explore function: Provides histograms, QQ plots, normality tests

Outlier detection: Boxplots and Mahalanobis distance

Missing Value Patterns: Graphical display if using the Missing Values module

📈 Quality Control Charts (QCC)
Available via IBM SPSS Statistics Quality Control module:

Control Chart Type	Description
X-bar, R, S Charts	For monitoring means and variability
P, NP, C, U Charts	Attribute control charts for proportions and counts
CUSUM & EWMA	Cumulative sum and exponentially weighted moving average
Pareto Charts	For defect analysis

📈 R Language
R provides superior, flexible, and fully customizable visualizations, with many packages focused on graphical output.

🎨 Base R Plotting Functions
plot(), hist(), barplot(), boxplot(), pairs(), qqnorm(), curve() – Easy-to-use for basic charts

🖌️ Popular Visualization Packages
